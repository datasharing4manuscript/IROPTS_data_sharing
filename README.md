# IROPTS_data_sharing
The attached files are open dataset for the research on integrated refined oil and power system. Everybody is welcomed to get a copy and do your own research. The dataset is collected with much time and effort, so PLEASE quote the dataset as a reference. Many thanks!
1. The physical properties, pipeline operational information and detailed pump characteristics data are given in **shared_parameters.xlsx.**
2. The reviewers can find the detailed parameters used in CASE 1 in the **detailed data for case 1.xlsx** and for CASE 2 in the **detailed data for case 2.xlsx**. They include the the station index based on which the variable speed pump parameters, flowrate of each pipeline in each time period, oil density of each station, pumping head and efficiency of each pump, estimated pressureloss at the start and end time of each time period, the gasoline-diesel-ratio and the simulated oil head position of the steady state flow simulation in the input parameter calculation stage are given.
3. **"TABLE3.xlsx"** presents the complete result in CASE 2 (abbreviated in TABLE III) in the paper.
Thanks for your precious time!
